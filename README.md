# Userscripts & Style Scripts
Random Userscripts for stuff

## BattleLog

### Slighty Better BattleLog
Changes various things about Battlelog. Adds the option to toggle the sidepanel to give more room, removes the top header of the page and moves some of the controls to the header below to free up more space.

### Remove Non-Conquest Assignments
Removes all the Battlefield 4 assignments that require playing game modes other than Conquest so that you have a better idea of what assignments you've done and what left without clogging it up with assignments from other gamemodes that you won't play.

## Slighty Better Google Photos
Some personal modifications I made to make Google Photos a bit better for myself, sorting my Wallpapers into groups and alphabetically.

## Slack

### Delete Button on Files List
Adds a Delete button next to the Star button to quickly delete files on your team. Slack doesn't have a way to quickly delete files without navigating the page so this will delete the file and then grey the item out once it has been deleted.

### Detailed Emoji Statistics
Displays how many Custom Emoji your team has and adds a button to view a detailed list of how many Emoji each user has added.

### Loading Message IDs
This just adds a new coloumn to the Loading Messages table showing the ID of the Loading Message

### Hide Empty Profile Showcases
Removes the option on the profile to add another showcase.

### Steam Holiday Profile
Changes your Steam Profile into the 2014 Holiday Themed profile.

### Steam's Blue
