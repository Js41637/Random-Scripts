## Bundle Stars Ownership & Trading Card Checker

Checks all games on a bundle and highlights games you own and tags games with Trading Cards

### NOTE
In order for this to work you have to edit the script when you install it and enter your Steam ID where it says at the top `var steamID = undefined;` e.g. `var steamID = '83479832749473284';`

### NOTE 2
Due to the way Bundle Stars site works, when you load onto a bundle bundle you will need to refresh the page as the site uses AJAX and does not actually redirect to pages but instead just fetchs them and updates the URL which TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey does not support.
